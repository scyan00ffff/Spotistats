Spotistats 

This project was created as part of an A level Comp Sci course where we were tasked with showcasing our development skills to create an application of some kind. 
I made the descision to make an application in python that connected to Spotify's publicly available API and retrieved data about a user's listening history and displayed this in a GUI. 
The program had room for expansion so i added a reconmmendations algorithm that took data from the user's listening history and suggested songs based on this history.
The finished project is very much rough around the edges and could definitely use some improvements which may come in the future. 

Some previews of the GUI:
